Data pertaining to and described in the publication "Displacement experiments provide evidence for path integration in Drosophila" https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.245289

### Publication abstract
Like many other animals, insects are capable of returning to previously visited locations using path integration,
which is a memory of travelled direction and distance. Recent studies suggest that Drosophila can also use path integration
to return to a food reward.
However, the existing experimental evidence for path integration in Drosophila has a potential confound:
pheromones deposited at the site of reward might enable flies to find previously rewarding locations even without
memory. Here, we show that pheromones can indeed cause na√Øve flies to accumulate where previous flies had been rewarded
in a navigation task. Therefore, we designed an experiment to determine if flies can use path integration memory
despite potential pheromonal cues by displacing the flies shortly after an optogenetic reward.
We found that rewarded flies returned to the location predicted by a memory-based model.
Several analyses are consistent with path integration as the mechanism by which flies returned to the reward.
We conclude that although pheromones are often important in fly navigation and must be carefully controlled for in future
experiments, Drosophila may indeed be capable of performing path integration.

### Experiments procedure overview
There were two independent experiments: the pheromone experiment and the displacement experiment.

In the pheromone experiment the trajectories of groups of flies walking in the circular 20 cm diameter arena were recorded.
The comparison is between two conditions: "without emitter" and "with emitter", emitter meaning presence of another group of flies in the smaller circular area of the arena floor (reward zone) prior to the test recording (see the manuscript for details).
This dataset contains processed data: pooled histograms of flies' positions and the computed fractions of time spent in the reward zone.

The displacement experiment was performed on individual flies.
The fly was walking freely in the 60 cm diameter arena and was tracked using IR sensitive camera.
We performed stimulation by the red LED,
when the fly was inside the reward zone (a small circular area of the floor).
After stimulation the fly was displaced on a flat slider.
In the non-rewarded condition the LED was plugged out, but the times when it would be turned on are indicated with the positive value of intensity as in rewarded condition.
The dataset contains the preprocessed recorded trajectories (coordinates over time), as well as the files with the processed data, necessary to generate the figures of the associated article.


## Description of the data and file structure
Pheromones folder contains files related to the pheromone experiment.
All the other files relate to the displacement experiment.

### pheromones - folder related to the pheromone experiment
#### `*.npz` files
These files contain 2d histogram values of flies' positions for two experimental conditions: with emitter and without emitter.
They are used to produce Figure 1B.
The `npz` files contain keys: `h` for the matrix of histogram values; `xe`, `ye` for the x and y edges (as the outputs of `numpy.histogram2d()` function).
* `heatmap_emitter.npz`, `heatmap_no_emitter.npz` - for time period from 5 to 30 minute;
* `heatmap_emitter1_15.npz`, `heatmap_no_emitter1_15.npz`  - for time period from 1 to 15 minute.

#### `pheromone_test_fracs5_30.tsv`
The table with metadata and calculated fractions of time spent by the group of flies inside the reward zone during each trial.
Every row corresponds to one trial.

Useful columns:
* `host` - experimental setup id
* `t` - date and time when the recording was made
* `experiment` - experiment condition; `mass_test_no` means no flies have previously been in the arena, `mass_test` means that another group of flies was kept inside the reward zone and exposed to the optogenetic reward prior the test group.
* `fly_info` - some information about the experimental flies in JSON format. `dob` - date of birth, `starve` - from what time the flies were starved on water.
* `fraction` - the relative amount of time flies spent inside the reward zone in 5-30 min of the recording.

### `temperature.csv`
The file contains temperature measurements in the fly walking arena used in the displacement experiment, contributes to Figure S2A of the paper. The arena is circular, has 60 cm diameter and the walls are heated.
The measurements were taken along two axes.

File contents:
* `axis`: x / y
* `comment`
* `t` &mdash; arena temperature readout, &deg;C
* `time` &mdash; reading time in format HH:MM
* `troom` &mdash; room temperature readout

### `flytrax20181204_170930`
This is a folder that contains files associated with one trial of the displacement experiment,
used to create figure S3A of the manuscript, which illustrates the downsampling procedure
applied to the trajectory data.
The filename contains the date and time when the recording was started (04.12.2018 at 17:09:30).
The files contain coordinates of a fly walking freely in the arena (60 cm diameter).
The coordinates were recorded in camera pixels.

Three files represent processing stages:

   * `frame` - frame number from the camera
   * `x_px, y_px` - coordinates of the detected object in camera view
   * `slope`, deg - not informative in this case (should represent the heading of the fly, but in this setup the fly is too small for correct estimation)
   * `led_1, led_2, led_3`, relative units - the intensity of stimulation LEDs. Only LED1 was used to deliver the stimulus (optogenetic reward, see the publication for details).
   * `central_moment, keep` - uninformative

2) `ds_t01_flytrax20181204_170930.csv` contains the data downsampled by time with step 0.1 s
